P4
------------
P4 is a high-level programming language for software-defined networks. It is intended to describe the behavior of the data plane of any system or appliance that forwards, modifies or inspects network traffic. Researchers are innovating using P4 in server-based networking systems with novel approaches to offloading servers using SmartNICs and realizing new functionality. Open-NFP is helping facilitate this research and bring the community together. Below are a number of educational resources and various research projects currently being developed by our community.
