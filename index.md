------------------------------------
Open-nfp promotes collaborative research in the area of network function processing in server networking hardware. Open-nfp supports research on datapath acceleration in P4, P4/C and eBPF.

P4
---
P4 is a high-level programming language for software-defined networks. Below are a number of educational resources and various research projects currently being developed by our community.

P4 Tutorials 
------------
- [Building a Custom Tunnel with P4](https://github.com/open-nfpsw/p4_basic_lb_metering_nic)
- [Introduction to a NIC Wire APP in P4](https://github.com/open-nfpsw/p4wire)
- [Building a Custom Action with a C Sandbox in P4](https://github.com/open-nfpsw/c_packetprocessing)
