[Welcome to Open-NFP](http://www.open-nfp.org)
==============================================
[Open-NFP](http://www.open-nfp.org) promotes collaborative research in the area of network function processing in server networking hardware. Open-nfp supports reasearch on datapath acceleration in P4, P4/C and eBPF.

P4
---
P4 is a high-level programming language for software-defined networks. Below are a number of educational resources and various research projects from the  open-nfp community.

### P4 Tutorials
A hands on introduction to the P4 language. Tutorials with code with come with step-by-step instructions to run on production networking [hardware](http://open-nfp.org/resources/)
- [Building a Custom Tunnel with P4](https://github.com/open-nfpsw/p4_basic_lb_metering_nic)
- [Introduction to a NIC Wire APP in P4](https://github.com/open-nfpsw/p4wire)
- [Building a Custom Action with a C Sandbox in P4](https://github.com/open-nfpsw/c_packetprocessing)
- [Telemetry and VNFs](https://github.com/open-nfpsw/vnf_telemetry_lab)
- [An Introduction to the P4 Language](http://open-nfp.org/documents/54/iee_nfv_conference_p4tutorial_SRFpcZX.pdf)
