==============================================
###Open-NFP promotes collaborative research in the area of network function processing in server networking hardware. Open-NFP supports research on datapath acceleration in P4, P4/C and eBPF.

P4
---
P4 is a high-level programming language for software-defined networks. Below are a number of educational resources and various research projects currently being developed by our community.
