[Welcome to Open-NFP](http://www.open-nfp.org)
==============================================
[Open-NFP](http://www.open-nfp.org) promotes collaborative research in the area of network function processing in server networking hardware. Open-nfp supports reasearch on datapath acceleration in P4, P4/C and eBPF.

P4
---
P4 is a high-level programming language for software-defined networks. Below are a number of educational resources and various research projects from the  open-nfp community.

### P4 Tutorials
A hands on introduction to the P4 language. Tutorials with code with come with step-by-step instructions to run on production networking [hardware](http://open-nfp.org/resources/)
- [A P4 Tutorial to Build a Basic NIC](https://github.com/open-nfpsw/p4_basic_lb_metering_nic)
- [A P4 Tutorial to Build a Load Balancing Metering NIC](https://github.com/open-nfpsw/p4_basic_lb_metering_nic)
- [A P4 Tutorial lab for the P4 INT telemetry protocol with VNF](https://github.com/open-nfpsw/vnf_telemetry_lab)
- [A P4 Tutorial lab to implement meters with P4](https://github.com/open-nfpsw/meters_lab)
- [An Introduction to the P4 Language](http://open-nfp.org/documents/54/iee_nfv_conference_p4tutorial_SRFpcZX.pdf)

### P4 Apps to Jump Start Your Project
Many apps are accompanied by [webinars and docs](http://open-nfp.org/the-classroom/)
- [P4 for Custom Identification and Flow Tagging](https://github.com/open-nfpsw/P4Probe)
- [P4-based VNF and Micro-VNF Chaining for Servers With SmartNICs](https://github.com/open-nfpsw/p4_vnf_uvnf_demo)
- [P4 and C Stateful Firewall](https://github.com/open-nfpsw/p4c_firewall)
- [Accelerating Networked Applications with Flexible Packet Processing](https://github.com/open-nfpsw/flexnic)
- [Network Measurement with P4 and C on Netronome NFPâ€‹](https://github.com/open-nfpsw/M-Sketch)
- [Consensus as a Network Service](https://github.com/open-nfpsw/NetPaxos)

OVS

An introduction to using accelerated Open vSwitch
- [OVS Lab](https://github.com/open-nfpsw/ovs_lab)

ICONICS
-------
[ICONICS](http://www.iconics.io) allows users to test and deploy P4 applications on Agilio Smart NICs without needing to use a P4/SDK toolchain. With ICONICS, users can install SmartNIC applications much as software applications are installed on a server.
